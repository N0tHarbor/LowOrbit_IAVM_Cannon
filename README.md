# LowOrbit_IAVM_Cannon
A recreation to the Tenible Nessus IAVM mapping feature writen in Powershell. Intended for ACAS systems going through onboarding that are manually mapping IAVM's to CVE's. Often ACAS Suite plugins are managed by lazy and unresponsive admins. This TEMPORARY solution saves the 20-30 man hours of manually mapping IVAM's to CVE's
